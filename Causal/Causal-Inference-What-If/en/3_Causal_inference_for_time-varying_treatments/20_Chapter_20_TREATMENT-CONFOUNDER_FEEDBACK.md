# Chapter 20 TREATMENT-CONFOUNDER FEEDBACK

The previous chapter identified sequential exchangeability as a key condition to identify the causal effects of time-varying treatments. Suppose that we have a study in which the strongest form of sequential exchangeability holds: the measured time-varying confounders are sufficient to validly estimate the causal effect of any treatment strategy. Then the question is what confounding adjustment method to use. The answer to this question highlights a key problem in causal inference about time-varying treatments: **treatment-confounder feedback** .

When treatment-confounder feedback exists, using traditional adjustment methods may introduce bias in the effect estimates. That is, even if we had all the information required to validly estimate the average causal effect of any treatment strategy, we would be generally unable to do so. This chapter describes the structure of treatment-confounder feedback and the reasons why traditional adjustment methods fail.

### 20.1 The elements of treatment-confounder feedback

Consider again the sequentially randomized trial of individuals with HIV that we discussed in the previous chapter. For every person in the study, we have data on treatment $A_k$ (1: treated, 0: untreated) and covariates $L_k$ at each month of follow-up $k = 0, 1, 2 \ldots K$, and on an outcome $Y$ that measures health status at month $K+1$.

The causal diagram in Figure 20.1, which is equal to the one in Figure 19.2, represents the first two months of the study. The time-varying covariates $L_k$ are time-varying confounders. (As in the previous chapter, we are using this example without censoring so that we can focus on confounding.)

Something else is going on in Figure 20.1. Not only is there an arrow from CD4 cell count $L_k$ to treatment $A_k$, but also there is an arrow from treatment $A_{k-1}$ to future CD4 cell count $L_k$—because receiving treatment $A_{k-1}$ increases future CD4 cell count $L_k$. That is, the confounder affects the treatment and the treatment affects the confounder. There is **treatment-confounder feedback** (see also Fine Point 20.1).

Note that time-varying confounding can occur without treatment-confounder feedback. The causal diagram in Figure 20.2 is the same as the one in Figure 20.1, except that the arrows from treatment $A_{k-1}$ to future $L_k$ and $U_k$ have been deleted. In a setting represented by this diagram, the time-varying covariates $L_k$ are time-varying confounders, but they are not affected by prior treatment. Therefore, there is time-varying confounding, but there is no treatment-confounder feedback.

Treatment-confounder feedback creates an interesting problem for causal inference. To state the problem in its simplest form, let us simplify the causal diagram in Figure 20.1 a bit more. Figure 20.3 is the smallest subset of Figure 20.1 that illustrates treatment-confounder feedback in a sequentially randomized trial with two time points. When drawing the causal diagram in Figure 20.3, we made four simplifications:

- Because our interest is in the implications of confounding by $L_1$, we did not bother to include a node $L_0$ for baseline CD4 cell count. Just suppose that treatment $A_0$ is marginally randomized and treatment $A_1$ is conditionally randomized given $L_1$.
- The unmeasured variable $U_0$ is not included.
- There is no arrow from $A_0$ to $A_1$, which implies that treatment is assigned using information on $L_1$ only.
- There are no arrows from $A_0$, $L_1$, and $A_1$ to $Y$, which would be the case if treatment has no causal effect on the outcome $Y$ of any individual, i.e., the sharp null hypothesis holds.

>  **Representing feedback cycles with acyclic graphs.**  
> Interestingly, an acyclic graph—like the one in Figure 20.1—can be used to represent a treatment-confounder feedback loop or cycle. The trick to achieve this visual representation is to elaborate the treatment-confounder feedback loop in time. That is, $A_{k-1} \to L_k \to A_k \to L_{k+1}$ and so on.
>
> The representation of feedback cycles with acyclic graphs also requires that time be considered as a discrete variable. That is, we say that treatment and covariates can change during each interval $[k, k+1)$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, K$, but we do not specify when exactly during the interval the change takes place. This discretization of time is not a limitation in practice: the length of the intervals can be chosen to be as short as the granularity of the data requires. For example, in a study where individuals see their doctors once per month or less frequently (as in our HIV example), time may be safely discretized into month intervals. In other cases, year intervals or day intervals may be more appropriate. Also, as we said in Chapter 17, time is typically measured in discrete intervals (years, months, days) anyway, so the discretization of time is often not even a choice.

> Figure 20.4

None of these simplifications affect the arguments below. A more complicated causal diagram would not add any conceptual insights to the discussion in this chapter; it would just be harder to read.

Now suppose that treatment has no effect on any individual’s $Y$, which implies the causal diagram in Figure 20.3 is the correct one, but the investigators do not know it. Also suppose that we have data on treatment $A_{0}$ in month 0 and $A_{1}$ in month 1, on the confounder CD4 cell count $L_{1}$ at the start of month 1, and on the outcome $Y$ at the end of follow-up.

We wish to use these data to estimate the average causal effect of the static treatment strategy “always treat” ($a_{0} = 1, a_{1} = 1$), compared with the static treatment strategy “never treat” ($a_{0} = 0, a_{1} = 0$) on the outcome $Y$, i.e.,

$$
\mathrm{E} \left\lfloor Y^{a_{0}=1, a_{1}=1} \right\rfloor - \mathrm{E} \left\lfloor Y^{a_{0}=0, a_{1}=0} \right\rfloor.
$$

According to Figure 20.3, the true, but unknown to the investigator, average causal effect is 0 because there are no forward-directed paths from either treatment variable to the outcome. That is, one cannot start at either $A_{0}$ or $A_{1}$ and, following the direction of the arrows, arrive at $Y$.

Figure 20.3 can depict a sequentially randomized trial because there are no direct arrows from the unmeasured $U$ into the treatment variables. Therefore, as we discussed in the previous chapter, we should be able to use the observed data on $A_{0}$, $L_{1}$, $A_{1}$, and $Y$ to conclude that

$$
\mathrm{E} \left\lfloor Y^{a_{0}=1, a_{1}=1} \right\rfloor - \mathrm{E} \left\lfloor Y^{a_{0}=0, a_{1}=0} \right\rfloor
$$

is equal to 0. However, as we explain in the next section, we will not generally be able to correctly estimate the causal effect when we adjust for $L_{1}$ using traditional methods, like stratification, outcome regression, and matching. That is, in this example, an attempt to adjust for the confounder $L_{1}$ using these methods will generally result in an effect estimate that is different from 0, and thus invalid.

Figure 20.3 represents either a sequentially randomized trial or an observational study with no unmeasured confounding; Figure 20.4 represents an observational study.

In other words, when there are time-varying confounders and treatment-confounder feedback, traditional methods cannot be used to correctly adjust for those confounders. Even if we had sufficient longitudinal data to ensure sequential exchangeability, traditional methods would not generally provide a valid estimate of the causal effect of any treatment strategies. In contrast, g-methods appropriately adjust for the time-varying confounders even in the presence of treatment-confounder feedback.

This limitation of traditional methods applies to settings in which the time-varying confounders are affected by prior treatment as in Figure 20.3, but also to settings in which the time-varying confounders share causes $W$ with prior treatment as in Figure 20.4, which is a subset of Figure 19.4. We refer to both Figures 20.3 and 20.4 (and Figures 19.2 and 19.4) as examples of treatment-confounder feedback. The next section explains why traditional methods cannot adequately handle treatment-confounder feedback.

### 20.2 The bias of traditional methods

This is an ideal trial with full adherence to the assigned treatment strategy and no losses to follow-up.

**Table 20.1**

| N    | A0  | L1  | A1  | Mean Y |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- | ------ |
| 2400 | 0   | 0   | 0   | 84     |
| 1600 | 0   | 0   | 1   | 84     |
| 2400 | 0   | 1   | 0   | 52     |
| 9600 | 0   | 1   | 1   | 52     |
| 4800 | 1   | 0   | 0   | 76     |
| 3200 | 1   | 0   | 1   | 76     |
| 1600 | 1   | 1   | 0   | 44     |
| 6400 | 1   | 1   | 1   | 44     |

If there were additional times $k$ at which treatment $A_k$ were affected by $L_k$, then $L_k$ would be a time-varying confounder. Figure 20.3 represents the null because there is no arrow from $L_1$ to $Y$. Otherwise, $A_0$ would have an effect on $Y$ through $L_1$.

To illustrate the bias of traditional methods, let us consider a (hypothetical) sequentially randomized trial with 32,000 individuals with HIV and two time points $k = 0$ and $k = 1$. Treatment $A_0 = 1$ is randomly assigned at baseline with probability 0.5. Treatment $A_1$ is randomly assigned in month 1 with a probability that depends only on the value of CD4 cell count $L_1$ at the start of month 1—0.4 if $L_1 = 0$ (high), 0.8 if $L_1 = 1$ (low). The outcome $Y$, which is measured at the end of follow-up, is a function of CD4 cell count, concentration of virus in the serum, and other clinical measures, with higher values of $Y$ signifying better health.

Table 20.1 shows the data from this trial. To save space, the table displays one row per combination of values of $A_0$, $L_1$, and $A_1$, rather than one row per individual. For each of the eight combinations, the table provides the number of subjects $N$ and the mean value of the outcome $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0, L_1, A_1]$. Thus, row 1 shows that the mean of the 2400 individuals with $(A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 0)$ was $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 0] = 84$.

In this sequentially randomized trial, the identifiability conditions—sequential exchangeability, positivity, consistency—hold. By design, there are no confounders for the effect of $A_0$ on $Y$, and $L_1$ is the only confounder for the effect of $A_1$ on $Y$ so (conditional on $L_1$) sequential exchangeability holds. By inspection of Table 20.1, we can conclude that the positivity condition is satisfied, because otherwise one or more of the eight rows would have zero individuals.

The causal diagram in Figure 20.3 depicts this sequentially randomized experiment when the sharp null hypothesis holds. To check whether the data in Table 20.1 are consistent with the causal diagram in Figure 20.3, we can separately estimate the average causal effects of each of the time-fixed treatments $A_0$ and $A_1$ within levels of past covariates and treatment, which should all be null. In the calculations below, we will ignore random variability.

A quick inspection of the table shows that the average causal effect of treatment $A_1$ is indeed zero in all four strata defined by $A_0$ and $L_1$. Consider the effect of $A_1$ in the 4000 individuals with $A_0 = 0$ and $L_1 = 0$, whose data are shown in rows 1 and 2 of Table 20.1. The mean outcome among those who did not receive treatment at time 1, $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 0]$, is 84, and the mean outcome among those who did receive treatment at time 1,

> G-null test. Suppose the sharp null hypothesis is true. Then any counterfactual outcome $Y^g$ is the observed outcome $Y$. In this setting, sequential exchangeability for all $Y^g$ can be written as $Y \bot A_0 \mid L_0$ and $Y \bot \bot A_1 \mid A_0, L_0, L_1$ in a study with two time points. (We have used the fact that, for any values of $a_0$ and $l_0$, there exist strategies $g$ such that $a_0 = g(l_0)$.) Therefore, under sequential exchangeability, a test of these conditional independencies is a test of the sharp null. This is the $\mathsf{g}$-null test (Robins 1986). Note the first independence implies no causal effect of $A_0$ in any strata defined by $L_0$, and the second independence implies no causal effect of $A_1$ in any strata defined by $L_1$ and $A_0$.
>
> More generally, the $\mathsf{g}$-null theorem of Robins (1986) says that, under sequential randomization for all $g$, the above two independencies hold if and only if the distribution of $Y^g$ and therefore the mean $\operatorname{E}[Y^g]$ is the same for all $g$, and also equal to the distribution and mean of the observed $Y$.

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{The weighted average is} \\
\frac{2400}{16000} \times 84 + \frac{1600}{16000} \times 84 + \\
\frac{2400}{16000} \times 52 + \frac{9600}{16000} \times 52 = 60
\end{array}
$$

$\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 1]$ is also 84. Therefore the difference

$$
\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 1] - \operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 0]
$$

is zero. Because the identifiability conditions hold, this associational difference validly estimates the average causal effect

$$
\operatorname{E}[Y^{a_1 = 1} \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0] - \operatorname{E}[Y^{a_1 = 0} \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0]
$$

in the stratum $(A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0)$. Similarly, it is easy to check that the average causal effect of treatment $A_1$ on $Y$ is zero in the remaining three strata $(A_0 = 0, L_1 = 1)$, $(A_0 = 1, L_1 = 0)$, $(A_0 = 1, L_1 = 1)$, by comparing the mean outcome between rows 3 and 4, rows 5 and 6, and rows 7 and 8, respectively.

We can now show that the average causal effect of $A_0$ is also zero. To do so, we need to compute the associational difference $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 1] - \operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0]$ which, because of randomization, is a valid estimator of the causal contrast $\operatorname{E}[Y^{a_0 = 1}] - \operatorname{E}[Y^{a_0 = 0}]$. The mean outcome $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0]$ among the $16,000$ individuals treated at time 0 is the weighted average of the mean outcomes in rows 1, 2, 3 and 4, which is 60. And $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 1]$, computed analogously, is also 60. Therefore, the average causal effect of $A_0$ is zero.

We have confirmed that the causal effects of $A_0$ and $A_1$ (conditional on the past) are zero when we treat $A_0$ and $A_1$ separately as time-fixed treatments. What if we now treat the joint treatment $(A_0, A_1)$ as a time-varying treatment and compare two treatment strategies? For example, let us say that we want to compare the strategies “always treat” versus “never treat”, that is $(a_0 = 1, a_1 = 1)$ versus $(a_0 = 0, a_1 = 0)$. Because the identifiability conditions hold, the data in Table 20.1 should suffice to validly estimate this effect.

Because the effect for each of the individual components of the strategy, $a_0$ and $a_1$, is zero, it follows from the g-null theorem (see Technical Point 20.1) that the average causal effect $\operatorname{E}[Y^{a_0 = 1, a_1 = 1}] - \operatorname{E}[Y^{a_0 = 0, a_1 = 0}]$ is zero. But is this what we conclude from the data if we use conventional analytic methods? To answer this question, let us conduct two data analyses. In the first one, we do not adjust for the confounder $L_1$, which should give us an incorrect effect estimate. In the second one, we do adjust for the confounder $L_1$ via stratification.

1. We compare the mean outcome in the 9600 individuals who were treated at both times (rows 6 and 8 of Table 20.1) with that in the 4800 individuals who were untreated at both times (rows 1 and 3). The respective averages are $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 1, A_1 = 1] = 54.7$, and $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, A_1 = 0] =$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 1, A_1 = 1] & = \frac{3200}{9600} \times 76 + \frac{6400}{9600} \times 44 = 54.7 \\
\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, A_1 = 0] & = \frac{2400}{4800} \times 84 + \frac{2400}{4800} \times 52 = 68.0
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that, because the effect is $10^{-8}$ in both strata of $L_1$, it is not possible that a weighted average of the stratum-specific effects will yield the correct value 0.68. The associational difference is $54.7 - 68 = -13.3$ which, if interpreted causally, would mean that not being treated at either time is better than being treated at both times. This analysis gives the wrong answer—a non-null difference—because $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = a_0, A_1 = a_1]$ is not a valid estimator of $\operatorname{E}[Y^{a_0, a_1}]$. Adjustment for the confounder $L_1$ is needed.

2. We adjust for $L_1$ via stratification. That is, we compare the mean outcome in individuals who were treated with that in individuals who were untreated at both times, within levels of $L_1$. For example, take the stratum $L_1 = 0$. The mean outcome in the treated at both times, $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 1, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 1]$, is 76 (row 6). The mean outcome in the untreated at both times, $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 0, A_1 = 0]$, is 84 (row 1). The associational difference is $76 - 84 = -8$ which, if interpreted causally, would mean that, in the stratum $L_1 = 0$, not being treated at either time is better than being treated at both times.

Similarly, the difference $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 1, L_1 = 1, A_1 = 1] - \operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = 1, A_1 = 0]$ in the stratum $L_1 = 1$ is also $-8$.

What? We said that the effect estimate should be 0, not $-8$. How is it possible that the analysis adjusted for the confounder also gives a wrong answer? This estimate reflects the bias of traditional methods to adjust for confounding when there is treatment-confounder feedback. The next section explains why the bias arises.

## 20.3 Why traditional methods fail

Table 20.1 shows data from a sequentially randomized trial with treatment-confounder feedback, as represented by the causal diagram in Figure 20.3. Even though no data on the unmeasured variable $U_1$ (immunosuppression level) is available, all three identifiability conditions hold: $U_1$ is not needed if we have data on the confounder $L_1$. Therefore, as discussed in Chapter 19, we should be able to correctly estimate causal effects involving any static or dynamic treatment strategies. And yet our analyses in the previous section did not yield the correct answer, whether or not we adjusted for $L_1$.

The problem was that we did not use the correct method to adjust for confounding. Stratification is a commonly used method to adjust for confounding, but it cannot handle treatment-confounder feedback. Stratification means estimating the association between treatment and outcome in subsets—strata—of the study population defined by the confounders—$L_1$ in our example. Because the variable $L_1$ can take only two values—1 if the CD4 cell count is low, and 0 otherwise—there are two such strata in our example. To estimate the causal effect in those with $L_1 = l$, we selected (i.e., conditioned or stratified on) the subset of the population with value $L_1 = l$.

But stratification can have unintended effects when the association measure is computed within levels of a variable $L_1$ that is caused by prior treatment $A_0$. Indeed Figure 20.5 shows that conditioning on $L_1$—a collider—opens the path $A_0 \longrightarrow L_1 \longleftarrow U_1 \longrightarrow Y$. That is, stratification induces a noncausal association between the treatment $A_0$ at time 0 and the unmeasured variable $U_1$, and therefore between $A_0$ and the outcome $Y$, within levels of $L_1$. Among those with low CD4 count ($L_1 = 1$), being on treatment ($A_0 = 1$) becomes a marker for severe immunosuppression (high value of $U_1$); among those with a high level of CD4 ($L_1 = 0$), being off treatment ($A_0 = 0$) becomes a marker for milder immunosuppression (low value of $U_1$). Thus, the side effect of stratification is to induce an association between treatment $A_0$ and outcome $Y$.

### Fine Point 20.2

**Confounders on the causal pathway.** Conditioning on confounders $L_1$ which are affected by previous treatment can create selection bias even if the confounder is not on a causal pathway between treatment and outcome. In fact, no such causal pathway exists in Figures 20.5 and 20.6.

On the other hand, in Figure 20.7 the confounder $L_1$ for subsequent treatment $A_1$ lies on a causal pathway from earlier treatment $A_0$ to outcome $Y$, i.e., the path $A_0 \longrightarrow L_1 \longrightarrow Y$. If $U_1$ were not a common cause of $L_1$ and $Y$ in Figure 20.7 (i.e., if there were no selection bias), the $A-Y$ associations within strata of $L_1$ would be an unbiased estimate of the direct effects of $A_0$ on $Y$ not through $L_1$, but still would not be an unbiased estimate of the overall effect of $\bar{A}$ on $Y$, because the effect of $A_0$ mediated through $L_1$ is not included.

It is sometimes said that variables on a causal pathway between treatment and outcome cannot be considered as confounders, because adjusting for those variables will result in a biased effect estimate. However, this characterization of confounders is inaccurate for time-varying treatments. Figure 20.7 shows that a confounder for subsequent treatment $A_1$ can be on a causal pathway between past treatment $A_0$ and the outcome. As for whether adjustment for confounders on a causal pathway induces bias for the effect of a treatment strategy, that depends on the choice of adjustment method. Stratification will indeed induce bias; g-methods will not.

![image_132](../../images/image_132.png)

> Figure 20.7

In other words, stratification eliminates confounding for $A_1$ at the cost of introducing selection bias for $A_0$. The associational differences

$$
\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 1, L_1 = l, A_1 = 1] - \operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_0 = 0, L_1 = l, A_1 = 0]
$$

### 20.4 Why Traditional Methods Cannot Be Fixed

The number of data combinations is even greater because there are multiple confounders $L_k$ measured at each time point $k$.

We showed that stratification cannot be used as a confounding adjustment method when there is treatment-confounder feedback. But what about other traditional methods? For example, we could have used parametric outcome regression, rather than nonparametric stratification, to adjust for confounding. Would outcome regression succeed where plain stratification failed?

This question is particularly important for settings with high-dimensional data, because in high-dimensional settings we will be unable to conduct a simple stratified analysis like we did in the previous section. Consider data generated under Figure 20.5. Treatment $A_k$ occurs at two months $k = 0, 1$, which means that there are only $2^2 = 4$ static treatment strategies $\bar{a}$. But when the treatment $A_k$ occurs at multiple points $k = 0, 1, \dots, K$, we will not be able to present a table with all the combinations of treatment values. If, as is not infrequent in practice, $K$ is of the order of 100, then there are $2^{100}$ static treatment strategies $\bar{a}$, a staggering number that far exceeds the sample size of any study. The total number of treatment strategies is much greater when we consider dynamic strategies as well.

As we have been arguing since Chapter 11, we will need modeling to estimate average causal effects involving $\mathrm{E}[Y^{\bar{a}}]$ when there are many possible treatment strategies $\bar{a}$. To do so, we will need to hypothesize a dose-response function for the effect of treatment history $\bar{a}$ on the mean outcome $Y$. One possibility would be to assume that the effect of treatment strategies $\bar{a}$ increases linearly as a function of the cumulative treatment under each strategy. Under this assumption, all strategies that assign treatment for exactly three months have the same effect, regardless of the period when those three months of treatment occur—the first 3 months of follow-up, the last 3 months of follow-up, etc. The price paid for modeling is yet another threat to the validity of our estimates due to possible model misspecification of the dose-response function.

And yet paying this price does not buy any protection against the failure of traditional methods. In the presence of treatment-confounder feedback, regression modeling cannot possibly remove the bias of conventional stratification-based methods because regression is a conventional stratification-based method itself. For example, suppose that we have data generated under Figure 20.5. Let us define cumulative treatment $\operatorname{cum}(\bar{\mathcal{A}}) = \mathcal{A}_0 + \mathcal{A}_1$, which can take 3 values: 0 (if the individual remains untreated at both times), 1 (if the subject is treated at time 1 only or at time 2 only), and 2 (if the subject is treated at both times). The treatment strategies of interest can then be expressed as “always treat” $\operatorname{cum}(\bar{a}) = 2$, and “never treat” $\operatorname{cum}(\bar{a}) = 0$, and the average causal effect as:

$$
\operatorname{E}[Y^{\operatorname{cum}(\bar{a}) = 2}] - \operatorname{E}[Y^{\operatorname{cum}(\bar{a}) = 0}].
$$

Again, any valid method should estimate that the value of this difference is $0$.

Under the assumption that the mean outcome $\mathrm{E}[Y \mid \bar{A}, L_1]$ depends linearly on the covariate $\operatorname{cum}(\bar{A})$, we could fit the outcome regression model:

$$
\operatorname{E}[Y \mid \bar{A}, L_1] = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \operatorname{cum}(\bar{A}) + \theta_2 L_1.
$$

The associational difference $\mathrm{E}[Y \mid \operatorname{cum}(A) = 2, L_1] - \mathrm{E}[Y \mid \operatorname{cum}(A) = 0, L_1]$ is equal to $\theta_1 \times 2$. (The model correctly assumes that the difference is the same in the strata $L_1 = 1$ and $L_1 = 0$.) Therefore, some might want to interpret $\theta_1 \times 2$ as the average causal effect of “always treat” versus “never treat” within levels of the covariate $L_1$. But such causal interpretation is unwarranted because, as Figure 20.5 shows, conditioning on $L_1$ induces an association between $A_0$, a component of treatment $\operatorname{cum}(\bar{A})$, and the outcome $Y$. This implies that $\theta_1$—and therefore the associational difference of means—is non-zero even if the true causal effect is zero and the regression model for $\mathrm{E}[Y \mid A, L_1]$ is correct. A similar argument can be applied to matching.

G-methods are needed to appropriately adjust for time-varying confounders in the presence of treatment-confounder feedback.

### 20.5 Adjusting for Past Treatment

![image_135](../../images/image_135.png)

> Figure 20.10

One more thing before we discuss g-methods. For simplicity, we have so far described treatment-confounder feedback under simplified causal diagrams in which past treatment does not directly affect subsequent treatment. That is, the causal diagrams in Figures 20.3 and 20.4 did not include an arrow from $A_{0}$ to $A_{1}$. We now consider the more general case in which past treatment may directly affect subsequent treatment.

As an example, suppose doctors in our HIV study use information on past treatment history $A_{k-1}$ when making a decision about whether to prescribe treatment $A_{k}$ at time $k$. To represent this situation, we add an arrow from $A_{0}$ to $A_{1}$ to the causal diagrams in Figures 20.3 and 20.4, as depicted in Figures 20.8 and 20.9.

The causal diagrams in Figures 20.8 and 20.9 show that, in the presence of treatment-confounder feedback, conditioning on $L_{1}$ is insufficient to block all backdoor paths between treatment $A_{1}$ and outcome $Y$. Indeed, conditioning on $L_{1}$ opens the path $A_{1} \leftarrow A_{0} \rightarrow L_{1} \leftarrow U_{1} \rightarrow Y$ in Figure 20.8, and the path $A_{1} \leftarrow A_{0} \leftarrow W_{0} \rightarrow L_{1} \leftarrow U_{1} \rightarrow Y$ in Figure 20.9.

Of course, regardless of whether treatment-confounder feedback exists, conditioning on past treatment history is always required when past treatment has a non-null effect on the outcome, as in the causal diagram of Figure 20.10. Under this diagram, treatment $A_{0}$ is a confounder of the effect of treatment $A_{1}$.

Therefore, sequential exchangeability at time $k$ generally requires conditioning on treatment history $\bar{A}_{k-1}$ before $k$; conditioning only on the covariates $L$ is not enough. That is why, in this and in the previous chapter, all the conditional independence statements representing sequential exchangeability were conditional on treatment history.

Past treatment plays an important role in the estimation of effects of time-fixed treatments too. Suppose we are interested in estimating the effect of the time-fixed treatment $A_{1}$—as opposed to the effect of a treatment strategy involving both $A_{0}$ and $A_{1}$—on $Y$. (Sometimes the effect of $A_{1}$ is referred to as the _short-term effect_ of the time-varying treatment $A$.) Then lack of adjustment for past treatment $A_{0}$ will generally result in selection bias if there is treatment-confounder feedback, and in confounding if past treatment $A_{0}$ directly affects the outcome $Y$.

In other words, the difference $\operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_{1}=1, L_{1}] - \operatorname{E}[Y \mid A_{1}=0, L_{1}]$ would not be zero even if treatment $A_{1}$ had no effect on any individual’s outcome $Y$, as in Figures 20.8–20.10. In practice, when making causal inferences about time-fixed treatments, bias may arise in analyses that compare current users ($A_{1}=1$) versus nonusers ($A_{1}=0$) of treatment. To avoid the bias, one can adjust for prior treatment history or restrict the analysis to individuals with a particular treatment history. This is the idea behind **“new-user designs”** for time-fixed treatments: restrict the analysis to individuals who had not used treatment in the past.

If one could correctly adjust for past treatment, the analysis would not need to be restricted to new users. Robins (1987) showed that randomly mismeasured treatment may lead to bias away from the null.

The requirement to adjust for past treatment has additional bias implications when past treatment is mismeasured. As discussed in Section 9.3, a mismeasured confounder may result in effect estimates that are biased, either upwards or downwards. In our HIV example, suppose investigators did not have access to the study participants’ medical records. Rather, to ascertain prior treatment, investigators had to ask participants via a questionnaire. Since not all participants provided an accurate recollection of their treatment history, treatment $A_{0}$ was measured with error. Investigators had data on the mismeasured variable $A_{0}^{\ast}$ rather than on the variable $A_{0}$.

To depict this setting in Figures 20.8–20.10, we add an arrow from the true treatment $A_{0}$ to the mismeasured treatment $A_{0}^{\ast}$, which shows that conditioning on $A_{0}^{\ast}$ cannot block the biasing paths between $A_{1}$ and $Y$ that go through $A_{0}$. Investigators will then conclude that there is an association between $A_{1}$ and $Y$, even after adjusting for $A_{0}^{\ast}$ and $L_{1}$, despite the lack of an effect of $A_{1}$ on $Y$.

Therefore, when treatment is time-varying, we find that, contrary to a widespread belief, mismeasurement of treatment—even if the measurement error is independent and non-differential—may cause bias under the null. This bias arises because past treatment is a confounder for the effect of subsequent treatment, even if past treatment has no causal effect on the outcome. Furthermore, under the alternative, this imperfect bias adjustment may result in an exaggerated estimate of the effect.
